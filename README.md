# [1] Title: Modelling Civic Problem-Solving in Smart City Using Knowledge-Based Crowdsourcing 

Summarized abstract: The paper proposes a hybrid human–machine crowdsourcing
architecture and a five‑stage “Penta‑Process” to capture, refine, and validate citizen
knowledge for complex civic problems, illustrated with a healthcare guideline use case in
smart‑city settings. It defines layered components for sensing, task generation,
recommendation, and aggregation to produce “democratic knowledge spaces” that
optimize task workflows and inform policy and service decisions.



# [2] Title: A CROWDSOURCED COMPLAINT RESOLUTION SYSTEM USING GEOTAGGING AND
SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT

Summarized abstract: The paper introduces Civic Alerts, a Flutter‑based platform where
citizens submit GPS‑tagged images of road issues, generating trackable tickets and
community upvotes to authenticate and prioritize reports. Built on Appwrite with Google
Maps integration, it targets faster, transparent municipal response through real‑time
updates, thresholded escalation, and an admin dashboard.



# [3] Title: Artificial intelligence and IoT driven system architecture for municipality waste management in smart cities: A review

Summarized abstract: This review surveys AI/IoT approaches to municipal solid waste and
proposes a sensor‑driven, NodeMCU‑based architecture that monitors bin fill levels, triggers
alerts, and optimizes truck routes via GPS and mapping. The framework aims to cut trips,
fuel, and emissions while improving cleanliness and service efficiency, and outlines
limitations and future enhancements like LoRaWAN, blockchain, and edge computing.



# [4] Title: FixMyStreet Brussels: Socio-Demographic Inequality in Crowdsourced Civic Participation

Summarized abstract: Using 30,041 reports 2013–2015, official statistics, and geotagged
Twitter data, the study finds significant participation gaps on FixMyStreet across Brussels
districts, with lower engagement from low‑income, North African, and Sub‑Saharan
communities. Results highlight digital divide and design factors, suggesting targeted
inclusivity, alternative data collection, and UI adjustments to broaden participation.



# [5] Title: CivicFix: Smart Complaint Routing for Urban Solutions

Summarized abstract: CivicFix is a cloud‑based complaint system where users upload issue
photos; ML classifies them into categories like potholes or garbage and auto‑routes cases to
the relevant departments with role‑specific dashboards. Leveraging ReactJS,
Node/Firebase, Google Maps, and OCR, it aims to streamline intake, tracking, and resolution
at scale with AI‑assisted triage and transparent status updates.



# [6] Title: Smart Civic Issue Reporting System

Summarized abstract: The work presents an Android complaint app that captures photos
and GPS, then prioritizes cases via a hybrid CNN‑RNN for image severity and SVM‑based
NLP for text cues. It follows a three‑tier MVC architecture with user, official, and admin roles
to accelerate reporting, ranking, routing, and feedback for urban infrastructure issues.



# [7] Title: Urban Crowdsourcing Platforms across the World: A Systematic Review

Summarized abstract: Following PRISMA, the review catalogs 32 data‑gathering urban
crowdsourcing platforms by purpose, geography, and data openness, noting a
predominance of qualitative studies and geographic bias in the literature. It clarifies inclusion
criteria, compares platform scopes like urban reporting and mobility, and discusses
implications for data access and citizen‑centric smart‑city design.
